# Draw up a DevOps process and explain what each represents:

**DevOps Process Explanation**
The DevOps process illustrated in the diagram shows the complete software delivery lifecycle that bridges Development and Operations teams. This represents the continuous flow of activities that enable faster, more reliable software delivery.

**Development Phase Components:**

1.	**Plan:** This initial stage involves gathering requirements from clients and planning the application development. This is where teams define what needs to be built and establish project roadmaps.
2.	**Code:** Developers write code for the application and use version control systems like Git to manage it. This allows multiple developers to collaborate while maintaining code integrity and version history.
3.	**Build:** This phase includes validating, compiling, and packaging the application. Build processes transform source code into executable packages through validation, compilation, unit testing, and integration testing.
4.	**Test:** Testing involves end-user and functional testing of the application. This ensures the application meets quality standards before moving to production environments.
   
**Operations Phase Components:**

5.	**Release:** This is where the tested application is prepared for deployment to production. It represents the transition point between development and operations activities.
6.	**Deploy:** The application is deployed onto production servers. Configuration management tools provision and configure environments to ensure consistency across deployments.
7.	**Monitor:** Once deployed, applications are continuously monitored to ensure they operate correctly and to identify potential issues before they impact users.
8.	**Operate:** This involves maintaining the application in production, addressing issues, and ensuring optimal performance.

**Continuous Practices (Green Boxes):**

1.	**Continuous Planning:** Represents ongoing requirement gathering and planning rather than a one-time activity at project initiation.
2.	**Continuous Development:** Shows how code is continuously written, committed, and integrated into the shared repository throughout the development cycle.
3.	**Continuous Testing:** Indicates automated testing that occurs throughout the development process, not just at predefined testing phases.
4.	**Continuous Release & Deploy:** Represents automated deployment pipelines that move code from development to production environments, enabling frequent and reliable releases.
5.	**Continuous Monitoring:** Shows how applications are constantly monitored after deployment to maintain system health and performance.
6.	**Continuous Feedback & Optimization:** Represents how monitoring insights are used to improve the application and processes in an ongoing cycle.

The arrows spanning multiple phases illustrate how DevOps practices break down traditional silos - each continuous practice extends across multiple phases of the software delivery lifecycle, reinforcing the collaborative nature of DevOps culture. This integration creates a cycle of constant improvement where insights from operations directly influence planning and development activities.
